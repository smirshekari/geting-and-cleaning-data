#### This analysis consists of three scripts that explain the transformation of the Human Activity Recognition data from its raw form to a tidy dataset. 


* The **README.md** file explains how the scripts are connected.

* The **CodeBook.md** file describes the variables, the data, and the transformations of the data that were done to make it tidy.

* The **run_analysis.R** file is the R scrip used to transform the data from raw to tidy.
